# Pet-Projects

This repository contains all of my small practice projects completed through the Codedex platform.  
They are organized by language and each project includes its own README and source code.

## 📁 Structure

- `python/` — Python practice projects  
- `javascript/` — JavaScript mini apps  
- `html/` — Web layout and styling projects  
- `misc/` — Extra experiments or cross-language projects  

## 🚀 About

These projects are primarily learning-focused, helping me practice programming fundamentals, logic, and simple app building.  
As I improve, I may expand or refine some of these into full standalone repositories.
